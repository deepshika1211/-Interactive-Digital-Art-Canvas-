# -Interactive-Digital-Art-Canvas-
Interactive Digital Art Canvas - Java & DSA Project
🎨 A feature-rich digital drawing application built with Java, leveraging Data Structures & Algorithms for an optimized and interactive art experience.

🚀 Features
1. Real-Time Drawing Engine
Smooth brush strokes using Java 2D Graphics API.

Adjustable brush size, opacity, and hardness.

Supports freehand drawing, lines, circles, rectangles, and custom shapes.

2. Dynamic Color System
RGB/HEX color picker with a customizable palette.

Color blending and gradient effects.

3. Undo/Redo Functionality
Implemented using a Stack data structure for efficient state management.

Supports multiple undo/redo operations without performance lag.

4. Save & Load Artwork
Export drawings in PNG, JPEG, or custom file formats.

Serialization for saving and restoring project states.

5. Optimized Performance
Efficient event handling for smooth rendering.

Memory management to handle large-scale drawings.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Data Structures & Algorithms Used
Stack → For undo/redo operations.

2D Arrays → For pixel manipulation and canvas rendering.

Bresenham’s Line Algorithm → For smooth line drawing.

Flood Fill Algorithm → For bucket fill functionality.

🎨OOP & Design Patterns
MVC (Model-View-Controller) → Separates UI, logic, and data handling.

Singleton Pattern → Manages global settings like brush properties.

Factory Pattern → For creating different brush types dynamically.

🎨File Handling & Serialization
Uses Java’s ImageIO for saving/loading images.

Object serialization for storing project metadata
